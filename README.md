# PhenoMeNal H2020 E-Infrastructure Project

PhenoMeNal (Phenome and Metabolome aNalysis) is a comprehensive and standardised e-infrastructure that will support the data processing and analysis pipelines for molecular phenotype data generated by metabolomics applications. An infrastructure aimed to address the H2020 Societal Challenge in Health, Demographic Change and Wellbeing, PhenoMeNal will provide services enabling computation and analysis to improve the understanding of the causes and mechanisms underlying health, healthy ageing and diseases.
